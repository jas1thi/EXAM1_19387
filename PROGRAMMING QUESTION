1.	Create a new HTML document named: Exam1-Firstname-Lastname-SectionNumber (e.g., exam1¬-Mark-Smith-19387). (5 points)
 
2.	Inside your HTML document, insert a form that includes the following elements:

-- Two input fields for entering two different numbers. Each field should have a clear label: “Number 1:” and “Number 2:”. (5 points)
-- A drop-down list with two select options: one for multiplication (*) and one for division (/).  (5 points)
-- A submit button for user interaction (5 points) 

3.	Apply CSS styling (either internal or external) as detailed below: (5 points)
Set the background color of the first input field to pink.
Set the background color of the second input field to greenyellow. 

4.	Write a function or several functions so that clicking the submit button accomplishes the following: 
-- Executes the operation chosen via the selection area using the two numbers input by the user. (20 points)
-- Then displays a message: “The result is: xx”.  (5 points)

5.	Utilize event handling techniques to manage the form submission process: This ensures that the calculation 
and the message display are executed upon the button click and before the form is actually submitted. (10 points)
